# Quick resume of my life

Hi, I’m Ziyao, a second-year M.S. student in Computer Science at **Johns Hopkins University**, advised by **Prof. Eric Nalisnick**. I am also working with **Prof. Anqi Liu**. Before that, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2022, and I also worked as a Software Development Engineer at Alibaba prior to joining JHU.

I study how people and AI systems make decisions together, especially in real-world settings where environments, human behavior and model behavior can change over time. My work focuses on three core questions:
* How should we allocate tasks between humans and AI models?
* How can decision-making stay reliable when environments shift?
* How can foundation models show when they are unsure and improve their explainability?

### I'm also good at
* Programming (Python/Typescript/C++/C) (7+ years of experience)
* Leading full-stack application development
* Exploring and collecting authentic local cuisines
* Table tennis (especially proud of my killer backhand 😎)
* Photography 📷
