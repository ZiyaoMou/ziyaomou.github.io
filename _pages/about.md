# Quick resume of my life

Hi, I’m Ziyao, a second-year M.S. student in Computer Science at **Johns Hopkins University**, advised by **Prof. Eric Nalisnick** and **Prof. Anqi Liu**. 
Before that, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2022, and I also worked as a Software Development Engineer at Alibaba prior to joining JHU.

My research focuses on **human-AI collaboration** and **trustworthy AI**. I study how human factors influence system performance and decision-making, and how to model and calibrate uncertainty in machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms to build more reliable and adaptive AI systems.

### Interest
* Human-AI collaboration and human-in-the-loop learning
* Probabilistic modeling and uncertainty calibration
* Robust and safe reinforcement learning
* Safety, interpretability, and reliability in LLM


### I'm good at
* Programming (Python/C++/C/Typescript) (7+ years of experience)
* Leading full-stack application development
* Exploring and collecting authentic local cuisines
* Table tennis (especially proud of my killer backhand 😎)
* Photography 📷
